**pm-wrapper** is a [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com) wrapper for desktop, built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [Tauri](https://tauri.app/).

You can find application binaries to install in the [Releases](https://github.com/myferr/pm-wrapper/releases).

## Why make a wrapper?

ProtonMail provides an [official desktop app](https://proton.me/mail/download) but it costs a subscription (unlike the web app), so by making a wrapper you can use ProtonMail as a desktop app completely free of cost.
